The module assignment necessitated the creation of two for loops.  The first loop created entries for the ticker, opening and 
closing prices, and the volume.  The second loop formatted the price movement based on positive or negative growth and searched
the results to locate the ticker that saw the largest positive and negative growth as well as the highest volume for each year.

Finally, an over arching loop was created to perform these tasks on each sheet in the file.
